Revision history for Perl extension Geo::Postcodes
--------------------------------------------------
2017-12-20 14:00 Runar Buvik
 * Fixed 'Non-ASCII character seen before =encoding' error
 * Released version 0.33.

2006-10-01 22:00 Arne Sommer
 * Released version 0.32.

2006-10-01 14:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added the new selection modes 'nand', 'nand not', 'xnor', and 'xnor not'.

2006-09-30 22:00 Arne Sommer
 * Written the 'Geo::Postcodes::Ajax.pod' tutorial, showing how the
   'Geo::postcodes::*'-modules can be combined with ajax code in a html form
   to get the location updated automatically. The files in the tutorial are
   included in the distribution: 'eg/index.html', 'eg/location_u2.cgi' and
   'postcodecheck.js'.

2006-09-25 22:30 Arne Sommer
 * Released version 0.311.

2006-09-25 22:00 Arne Sommer
 * Fixed an error in the documentation for 'Geo::postcodes::Update' that
   caused an error in the test file 't/2_pod_coverage'.

2006-09-24 14:00 Arne Sommer
 * Released version 0.31.

2006-09-24 13:00 Arne Sommer
 * Rewritetten 'selection' to cope with modes as 'and', 'not' (instead of
   the correct 'and not'), as already done in 'verify_selectionlist'.

2006-09-22 22:00 Arne Sommer
 * Removed the procedure 'dryrun' in 'Geo::Postcodes::Update', and made it
   the default mode. Updated the country programs so that they must use
   '-update' on the command line to actually update the module.

2006-09-16 20:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added the procedure 'dryrun' to 'Geo::Postcodes::Update'. Use it, instead
   of 'update', to get the perl code printed to the screen instead of beeing
   written to the module. This is useful when writing the parsing procedure.

2006-09-15 22:00 Arne Sommer
 * 'Geo::Postcodes::Update::update' will now offer to download the postcode
   file from internet, if possible.

2006-09-15 10:00 Arne Sommer
 * 'Geo::Postcodes::Update::update' will now check the new data against the
    existing, and only update the file if they differ. Added a version number
    (0.31) at the same time.

2006-09-14 23:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added support for 'Build.PL', in addition to the present 'Makefile.PL'.
   This reqired a new directory lib in the distribution, and the move of
   the files 'Postcodes*' to it. 
 * Updated 'Update.pm' to cope with the move of 'bin/update' to 'misc/update'
   in the child modules.

2006-09-12 21:00 Arne Sommer
 * Released version 0.30.

2006-09-12 11:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added support for external procedures in 'selection', specified as
   'procedure' => \&procedure_name. The procedure is passed the postcode as
   argument, and must return true or false. 
 * Updated 'verify_selectionlist' to support this feature. It verifies that
   the procedures are actually callable.
 * Added tests in 't/3_validselection.t'.

2006-09-11 22:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added a comprehensive tutorial 'Postcodes::Tutorial.pod', using a fictiuos 
   country Utopia and the module name 'Geo::Postcodes::U2'.

2006-09-11 19:00 Arne Sommer
 * Moved the documentation for the 'selection' family of procedures/methods to
   a new file 'Postcodes/Selection.pod'.

2006-09-11 13:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added the test file 't/4_exporter.t' testing that the available methods and
   procedures really are available.

2006-09-09 11:00 Arne Sommer
 * Renamed the procedure/method 'get_methods' to 'get_fields', and 'is_method'
   to 'is_field', to avoid confusion with the generic name 'method'.

2006-09-07 20:00 Arne Sommer
 * Released version 0.21.

2006-09-07 19:30 Arne Sommer
 * Added the test file 't/3_validselection.t' testing the
   'verify_selectionlist' procedure.

2006-09-07 16:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added the test files 't/2_pod.t' and 't/2_pod_coverage.t' to check the
   documentation for errors and completeness, and fixed the reported
   shortcomings (mostly by dummy lines for now - as the documentation is due
   for a major reorganisation).

2006-09-07 14:30 Arne Sommer
 * Added the selection mode 'one', which will return just one (or zero)
   postcodes. It must be used initially, can be used on its own, and
   will return a random postcode.

2006-09-07 13:00 Arne Sommer
 * Removed the line 'use 5.008' from 'Makefile.PL', as there was no
   reason for this restriction.

2006-09-04 18:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added the procedure 'selection_loop' which will call the specified
   procedure for each resulting postcode from the 'selection' call. It
   is callable from the child classes (with some black magic).

2006-09-03 23:30 Arne Sommer
 * Released version 0.20.

2006-09-03 22:30 Arne Sommer
 * Fixed the errors and warnings in the documentation, as reported by
   'podchecker'.

2006-09-03 22:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added the procedure '_verify_selectionlist', which will return false (0)
   followed by a list of diagnostic messages if the argument list is invalid
   for use by the 'selection'-procedure. It will return true (1) followed by a
   modified argument list if the arguments are valid. The modification process
   replaces things as 'and', 'not' with 'and not'. The procedure is callable
   from the child classes (with some black magic).

2006-09-03 19:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added the modes 'xor not', 'nor' and 'nor not' in the selection procedure.

2006-09-01 17:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added the procedures 'get_selectionmodes' and 'get_initial_selectionmodes'
   to get a (sorted) list of the legal selection modes.

2006-09-01 11:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added the procedures 'is_legal_selectionmode' and
   'is_legal_initial_selectionmode' so that application programs easily can
   check for legal selection modes.

2006-09-01 01:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added the mode 'none' in the selection procedure. It will return absolutely
   nothing, and is absolutely useless.

2006-08-31 23:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added support for the mode 'all' as the first parameter in the selection
   procedure, as the old version of the procedure had it.

2006-08-31 22:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added support for the mode 'not' as the first parameter in the selection
   procedure, as it is clearer than 'and or' or 'and not'.

2006-08-31 16:00 Arne Sommer
 * Reimplemented the selection procedure, with the following modes only:
   'and', 'or', 'and not' (new), 'or not' (instead of 'not'), and 'xor'
   (new).

2006-08-17 15:00 Arne Sommer
 * Released version 0.10.

2006-08-16 22:00 Arne Sommer
 * Fixed an error that caused a list with one element (a zero) to be returned
   instead of 'undef' by selection when no matches were found.

2006-08-05 19:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added support for 'selection('all', ...)'. It does exactly the same as
   'get_postcodes' (but sorts the postcodes). It can be used to get them as
   objects, in oo-mode. This will consume a lot of memory - and time.

2006-08-05 19:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added support for 'selection('not', ...)'. It will include the postcode if
   it doesn't match any of the specified method/value pairs.

2006-07-30 14:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added support in 'selection' for multiple sets of method/value. This
   requires a choice of how to treat the combination, and this is controlled
   by the new 'and' and 'or' parameter.

2006-07-30 09:00 Arne Sommer
 * Renamed the 'methods' procedure/method to 'get_methods'.

2006-07-23 14:00 Arne Sommer
 * Released version 0.03.

2006-07-23 10:00 Arne Sommer
 * Simplified the 'selection' code by removing the need for passing a list of
   legal methods. This is now obtained by the selection code itself.

2006-07-19 22:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added the 'get_types' procedure that returns all the types (of the postal
   locations). Added the 'type2verbose' procedure to convert the code to an
   english text.

2006-07-20 18:00 Arne Sommer
 * Made a major rewrite of the documentation.

2006-07-19 14:00 Arne Sommer
 * Merged the national (norwegian and danish) postal type codes, and moved
   them here. 'type' and 'type_of' will now give the code (instead of the
   description). Use the new prodeure 'type_verbose_of' and method
   'type_verbose' for the description. The base class has english texts, but
   this can be overruled by the derived classes.

2006-07-18 23:00 Arne Sommer
 * Released version 0.02.

2006-07-18 18:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added the 'methods' and 'is_method' method/procedure.

2006-07-15 12:00 Arne Sommer
 * Added the 'selection' method/procedure, and made it callable from the child
   classes (with some black magic).

2006-07-10 16:00 Arne Sommer
 * Released version 0.01.

2006-07-07 19:00 Arne Sommer
 * Original version; created by 'h2xs -Xan Geo::Postcodes'.
